### Weather Data Analysis & Preprocessing Project
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on weather data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and preparation for prediction modeling.
It uses historical meteorological data to clean, analyze, and transform raw weather observations into a structured format suitable for analysis and visualization.

The work emphasizes data quality, consistency, and readiness for downstream analytics or machine learning models.
